Bastion Protocol

A modern, modular, and scalable Web3 protocol built using Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.
Bastion Protocol provides a strong foundation for building decentralized applications (dApps) with reusable components, custom hooks, and a clean architecture for long-term scalability.

⸻

🚀 Features
	•	⚡ Next.js 14 – Leveraging App Router for faster and scalable apps
	•	🎨 TailwindCSS – Utility-first styling for rapid UI development
	•	🛠 Reusable Components – Modular UI blocks stored in components/
	•	🔗 Web3 Ready – Easy integration with libraries like ethers.js and wagmi
	•	📦 Custom Hooks – Encapsulated logic in the hooks/ folder
	•	🧩 Clean Architecture – Organized lib/ folder for utilities and helpers
	•	🔥 Developer Experience – TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier for a clean and reliable codebase

🧩 Usage Guide

Adding New Components
	•	Place new UI blocks inside the components/ folder.
	•	Use props for reusability.
	•	Follow the naming convention: ComponentName.tsx.

Creating Custom Hooks
	•	Place reusable logic in the hooks/ folder.
	•	Example:

import { useState } from "react";

export const useCounter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return { count, increment: () => setCount(count + 1) };
};



Web3 Integration
	•	Easily integrate with ethers.js or wagmi by importing utilities in lib/ and managing state with custom hooks.

⸻

📖 Best Practices
	•	Maintain component reusability.
	•	Keep business logic in hooks, not components.
	•	Use TypeScript for type safety.
	•	Run npm run lint and npm run format before pushing changes.
